# cnn_forward_backward_in c plus

A framework for Convolutional nueral network forward and backward computation written in C++

Without using library the matrix operations are built on low levels, as the project only intends to provide a guidline and procedure on how it works.

class math_operations {
padding function
matrix elelement_wise multiply for y= A*X + b
activation wrapper and functions of relu, sigmoid, tanh
loss functions of cross-entropy and softmax
max and average pooling funtions
}

class cnn_forward  {



}
